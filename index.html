        <p>Welcome to codeOz.com demo site. This site is created after just 3 weeks into css and HTML. Before February first, I  have never created single line of code in my life. First two weeks I spend with code academy, and last 10 days I am working with teamtreehouse course. Every image represent one category and every category is part of my life. Feel free to click on any image to find out a little more about me. Right now links will redirect you to external sites, but my plan is to build up and optimize this page as a part of my next projects. </p>
